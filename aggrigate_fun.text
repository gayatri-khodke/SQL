Aggregate functions in SQL perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value. Here's a short explanation of some common aggregate functions:

COUNT(): Counts the number of rows.
SUM(): Adds up the values in a numeric column.
AVG(): Calculates the average of the values in a numeric column.
MIN(): Returns the smallest value in a column.
MAX(): Returns the largest value in a column.

ex:--
SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(salary), AVG(salary), MIN(salary), MAX(salary)
FROM employees;
